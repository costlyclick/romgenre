Sorting Roms by Genre

This is something that I put many hours into several years ago.

It will take a Nointro set for a console and sort all of the roms into subdirectories based on genre.

This was adapted from a list that a Russian gentleman had made using the old "Good" set. I wish I still remembered the source. :(

There are two options for each console. The default will make a verbose list with subdirectories like this:

	\Action (General)\Isometric
 	\Action (General)\Side-Scrolling
	\Action (General)\Top-Down

The second has an "f" for flat and will make folders that are a single level deep:

	\Action
	\Adventure
	\Beat'em Up

Supported consoles include:

	FBNeo 
	Mega Drive/Genesis
	N64
	NES
	PC Engine
	Sega Master System
	SNES
